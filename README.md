# jna_jython_test

Welcome to the JNA Jython Test! In this project, we demonstrate how to run Flask using Jython within a Netbeans project. By decompressing the project, you will discover that it is possible to deploy Flask servers using Jython standalone or compiled binaries.

The main objectives of this project are:

* Running Flask applications within Java and utilizing Java resources with Flask servers.
* Leveraging both Java and Python services in the background.
* Simplifying the configuration of REST APIs without the need for JSF, JSP, Django, Spring Boot, or Thymeleaf.
* Enabling RPC (Remote Procedure Call) functionality between the server and the client when used with Anvil Uplink.
* Compatibility with the Brython.js runtime.
* Compatibility with Blogger and Replit projects by incorporating a small amount of HTML code.
* When using Anvil Uplink, the ability to utilize ctypes and cppyy, swap stdin, stdout, stderr from the Python "sys" module for client & server, and run code remotely while still maintaining local accessibility.

If you need to know how to run the code, set it up inside of Netbeans and test it out. The Main.java file is
 what you're looking for. If you're templating from this, do know that pip does work with it, but it will give you
  a few errors during the install process. With that being said, do have fun with templating and tweaking the
 code. It took me up to 7 years to learn this stuff, so, please, take your time. All I ask is that it gets used
  wisely.
